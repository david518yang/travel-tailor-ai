## Audience

The audience of my app is anybody that likes travelling, and wants to discover new travel destinations that align with their preferences. 

## Introduction

Travel Tailor AI is a dynamic web application designed to transform the travel planning process. By seamlessly integrating Google Sign-In, the app ensures a secure and personalized user experience. The core of the app lies in its use of OpenAI's API, which intelligently generates travel recommendations tailored to each user's unique preferences. With the added functionality of saving and managing favorite destinations through Firebase Firestore, Travel Tailor AI not only simplifies the journey planning but also personalizes it to fit every user's dream itinerary. Whether you're an occasional traveler or a frequent flyer, this app is your companion in crafting memorable and bespoke travel experiences.
