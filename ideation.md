## Step 3: Map needs to Projects

`Background information provider, New destination recommender (based on preferences), Logistics planner`

## Step 4: Produce Goals/Ideas for Each Project

### Background information provider

<ul>
<li> Given a destination, provide some background information that a traveler should know before going
<li> Take into account user profile and preferences / things that the user would be doing there
<li> Give some cultural insight to the destination - including traditions/societal norms
<li> Prepare the user for travel by including a list of things to pack, what to expect, and how to navigate unexpected situations
</ul>

<li> Take into account user budget and cost of travelling in different destinations
<li> Offer a wide range of destinations to cater to different tastes
</ul>

<li> Based off the user's budget and preferences, finding the most ideal lodging/accomodation 
<li> Based off the user's preference of amount of time to travel for, optimize schedule and provide a loose itinerary
