- Travel Destination Recommender: Given a set of user preferences, generate some new travel destination recommendations using the OpenAI API.
- Background Information Provider: Given a travel destination, provide necessary background information such as local currency, climate, local traditions/norms, transportation methods, etc.

Also, once they receive these recommendations, gathering necessary background information about each destination (such as currency, local traditions/norms, transportation methods, etc.), and allowing users to save each recommended destination with the information into a firestore database.
